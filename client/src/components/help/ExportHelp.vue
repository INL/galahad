        <h2>Step 5: Export</h2>
        <p>
            First select the annotation layer you wish to export. You can export your annotated corpus in various
            formats. The export contains the metadata of the selected tagger. If the chosen export format is the same as
            the original file format, you can choose to merge the linguistic annotation with the uploaded source files.
            If you do not choose to merge, your export will not take the original encoding into account.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can choose not to export the PoS features, for instance <i>NOU-C</i> instead of <i>NOU-C(number=sg)</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            When choosing TEI P5 as export format, the LAnCeLoT annotation tool is available to manually correct the
            PoS-tagging and lemmatisation of your corpus.
